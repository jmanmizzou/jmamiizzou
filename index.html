    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>Over the past 20 years of my life I've picked up on many sports like <b>golf, football, and lacrosse throughout highschool.</b> After highschool, I did'nt play play much of any sport but enjoyed sill watching them. Every since highschool I've been super big on travel, computers, movies, and a little bit of coding.</p>

      <li>I am 20 years old</li>
      <li>I have a twim sister</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I've been to <i>3 festicals and over 150 concerts in my life!</i> With my favorite festival being <a href="https://lollastockholm.com/">lollapalooza</a> in Stockholm, Swedan!</p>
    
    <h3>Coding</h3>
    
    <p>I've been coding for a little over a year now, mostly in Python and I've really enjoyed most of it overall! From complicated problems to easy ones like:</p>
    
    <pre>
    <code>
        print("my name is Jackon Orr.")
        print("I am from columbia.")
    </code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>I Hope to attend these festivals next:</p>
    
    <table style="color:white;">
        <tr>
        <td>lollapalooza</td>
        <td>Forecastle</td>
        <td>roots and blues</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
